## Getting Started

1. **Install**: Search for "SQL Wayfarer" in VS Code Extensions
2. **Open**: Click the SQL Wayfarer icon in the activity bar or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and run "SQL Wayfarer: Open"
3. **Connect**: Add your SQL Server connection details in the Configuration tab
4. **Select Database**: Choose a database from the header dropdown
5. **Explore**: Navigate between different features using the main tabs
6. **View Code**: Select an object and switch to the Code tab to see SQL definitions

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Code Viewing
- Use the **Format** button to clean up messy SQL code
- Toggle **line numbers** for easier navigation in large procedures
- **Expand** the code view for better readability of complex objects
- **Copy** formatted code directly to use in other tools

### For Documentation
- Start with **table descriptions** to establish data context
- Document **complex columns** with business logic explanations
- Use the **edit mode** for bulk documentation updates
- Monitor **coverage statistics** to track documentation completeness

### For Dependency Analysis
- Use **dependency graphs** before making schema changes
- Check **table usage** to understand data flow patterns
- Analyze **triggers** to identify automated business logic
- Review **impact analysis** for refactoring planning

## Extension Settings

This extension does not add any VS Code settings. All configuration is managed within the SQL Wayfarer interface.

## Performance Considerations

- **Large databases** (1000+ objects): Initial loading may take 30-60 seconds
- **Dependency analysis**: Depth limited to 3 levels to prevent performance issues
- **Code formatting**: Basic formatting only; complex SQL may need manual adjustment
- **Extended Events**: Sessions are automatically cleaned up on extension reload

## Known Issues

- **Encrypted objects**: Cannot display code for encrypted stored procedures/functions
- **Complex schemas**: Very large schemas may experience slower rendering
- **Azure SQL Database**: Some Extended Events features may not be available
- **Syntax highlighting**: Basic SQL highlighting; advanced T-SQL features may not be colored

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify server name and port (default: 1433)
- Check firewall settings and network connectivity
- Ensure SQL Server authentication is enabled if using SQL auth
- Test connection before saving

### Performance Issues
- Close unused tabs to free memory
- Use search filters to limit object lists
- Consider connecting to specific databases rather than large instances

### Code View Issues
- Encrypted objects will show an error message
- Large procedures (10,000+ lines) may take time to load
- Some formatting may not work perfectly with complex T-SQL

## Release Notes

### 0.6.3
**Major Feature: Code View Integration**
- Added dedicated **Code tab** in Explorer for SQL object definitions
